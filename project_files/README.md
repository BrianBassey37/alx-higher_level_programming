Infrastructure:

1. Branching and Merging:
The team will follow the widely used Git branching model known as "GitHub flow." This workflow involves creating branches for new features, bug fixes, or improvements. Each team member will work on their respective branch, making regular commits to track progress. Once a feature or fix is complete, a pull request will be submitted for code review. After the code review process, the branch will be merged into the main branch (often called "master" or "main" branch). This allows for collaboration, easy tracking of changes, and ensures that the main branch remains stable.

2. Deployment Strategy:
The project will utilize a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment process. This involves setting up a build pipeline that automatically triggers when changes are pushed to the main branch. The pipeline will build the application, run tests, and generate the necessary artifacts for deployment. Once the build and tests pass successfully, the application will be deployed to the production environment.

3. Data Population:
To populate the app with data, the team will utilize a data import mechanism. The rich dataset will be imported into the application using a standardized format (such as CSV, JSON, or XML). Data preprocessing scripts or tools may be employed to sanitize and transform the data as needed before storing it in the application's database. The import process will be designed to handle large datasets efficiently and ensure data integrity.

4. Testing Tools and Automation:
The team will employ a combination of manual and automated testing approaches to ensure the quality and reliability of the application. The following testing tools, automation, and processes will be utilized:
